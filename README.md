# Homework-Week-06

I enjoyed writing the codes out this week, was the first time I have ever done a multi site website and actually had
everything work, well almost everything.. Had a lot of problems trying to get the video's to play, tried uploading in 
diffirent formats, think its because of how im linking the file but not sure, I was using the Link location that
is shown on github after I uploaded the video, not sure why this wouldnt work but on both firefox and chrome I could
not get the video to play, just show the video box.
